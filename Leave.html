        <h3 style="background-color:#ABEBC6;">You decide to turn back and leave...</h3>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> You decide to leave, you can always go back and explore tomorrow! You take one last look into the forest and decide its not worth it, you turn around and go back home. You feel yourself getting tired just walking into your house. You walk to the bed you found earlier, spread out your blanket and fluff up your pillow. You fuel the fire just enough to keep you warm for a few hours while you fall asleep. You climb into bed, thinking about what your new life will entail, and what could be in that forest... </p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> Your eyes slowly start to close as you fall asleep...</p>
        <h3 style="background-color: #ABEBC6;">Goodnight!</h3>
