    <h3 style="background-color:#ABEBC6;">You choose to enter the shack...</h3>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> When you enter the shack, the floor boards creak as you open the door and look around the small space. You find an old wood fire, a surprisingly good looking, functioning kitchen and a wooden bed which creaks eerily when you sit on it. You place your suitcase down on the floor next to your bed, take out the small travel pillow and thin blacket you brought with you for the bus journey here and place them on the bed with a creak.</p>

    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> You check your phone to see the "NO SIGNAL" bars and sigh, it's pretty late anyway, and you're too tired to find any service or try anything right now. Maybe you'll wake up tomorrow feeling energised!</p>
    <h3 style="background-color: #ABEBC6;">Time for bed!</h3>
