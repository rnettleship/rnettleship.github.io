    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> After living a boring, repetitive life in the city, you decide to finally fufil your dreams of becoming a farmer, just like your grandfather. You pack up your things and finally depart on the bus to the farm your grandfather left when he passed. The journey was long and tiring but so much excitement and anticipation flowed through you that you could never sleep! Once you arrived on your new farmland, to your left there was a small shack looking run-down but enough to live in, and a dark dense forest with small stone pathway leading into it. Now for your first choice...</p>
