        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> You decide it's probably best to get some rest before your first day in your new life, you can explore tomorrow! You walk to the bed you found earlier, spread out your blanket and fluff up your pillow. You fuel the fire just enough to keep you warm for a few hours while you fall asleep. The shack was surprisingly cold and probably needed some good TLC and love. You climb into your new bed, thinking about what your new life will entail! Your eyes start to slowly close as you fall asleep... </p>
