You walk further into the forest where the path slowly fades out the more you enter and before you know it, the path is completely gone and you're walking through leaves and bushes, pushing them past you as you walk forward. You stop to check if you can hear anything around you when suddenly you hear a crack to your left. You spin around quickly and stand frozen, trying to adjust your vision to see into the dense wood.

Your curiosity takes over and you find yourself walking towards it. You vision has mostly adjusted enough to navigate in front of yourself carefully, you keep your eyes glued ahead of you. You hear another crack, much closer this time.</p>
