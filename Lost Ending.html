        <h3 style="background-color:#ABEBC6;">You follow the creature...</h3>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> You quickly decide that you should follow the creature. What if it was friendly? What if it needed help? What if it needed a home? You walk as carefully and as fast as you can in the direction it ran off in, occasionally stopping for a split second to listen for any movement or noises. You keep walking for what feels like forever, until you stop for the last time and realise, you're lost.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> Panic starts to set in as you remember how far back it was since the path slowly started to disappear. You don't move. You listen out for any movement. You hear nothing. You sit down on the woodland floor, back against a tree and start to accept defeat, maybe you should've explored the path in the morning? Maybe it was best to go to bed for now?</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> As your mind repeats these thoughts, you think about your long journey here and how tired you must be. You can barely see anything around you, it's so dark, you try to keep your eyes open.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> You fall asleep. Maybe you should have just left...</p>
        <h3 style="background-color: #ABEBC6;">Uh Oh...</h3>
