        <h3 style="background-color:#ABEBC6;">You choose to take a look around the farm...</h3>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> You open your front door to find a box on your doorstep. You carefully inspect it and then bring it inside. There is no note or anything written on the box telling you who put it there or where it came from, but you open it anyway. Inside the small cardboard box, there are different coloured seed packets, 10 of each, 30 in total. Theres a note inside the box which reads:</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> "PLANT THESE, SELL TO PIERRE, CHECK INSIDE THE CUPBOARD NEXT TO THE FIRE - R."</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> You look over at the fire and notice a tall cupboard which you hadn't even thought to check yesterday. Upon opening the cupboard, you find an array of farming gear. A pair of gardening gloves, a hoe, a sickle, and a plain metal watering can. How handy, you thought. You take out all of the gear and look back in the box. You find 10 parsnip seeds, 10 bean seeds, and 10 jazz flower seeds. You reread the note, thinking to yourself, 'who is Pierre?... and who is R?'. Nonetheless, you take all of your new gardening gear outside along with the box and decideto get planting. You find a spacious plot of land and begin planting your seeds one by one, first the parsnips, then the jazz flowers, and finally the beans. You give them a good water, as much as you think they need, and decide that'll do. You've never really gardened before, except for when you were very young with your grandparents.</p>

        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> You look over your freshly planted crops, thinking about those times with your grandparents, reflecting on how good your new life will be.</p>
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;"> But who is 'R.'?...</p>
